## Objectives of the Project

The objectives of this project are to:
- Complete the systems development life cycle by designing, constructing, testing, and implementing a segment of the Phumla Kamnandi Hotels system.
- Develop a detailed systems specification for a single iteration of the project.
- Build, populate, and maintain a relational database.
- Understand how C#.net programs are structured and coded in an object-oriented environment.
- Provide students with the skills to develop larger and more complex systems in their third-year projects.

## Project Overview

In this project, students will work in groups of 2 to develop a Guest Booking function for Phumla Kamnandi Hotels. The following functionalities must be implemented:
- Make a Telephone Booking
- Change a Guest Booking
- Cancel a Guest Booking
- Make a Guest Booking Enquiry
- Generate dynamic reports on occupancy levels
- Additional relevant reports that bring business value

## System Specification Document Structure

1. **Introduction**
    - Provide context for the document, including an overview of the project and scope statement.

2. **Dialog Design**
    - Model the dialog between the user and the system using Interface Flow Diagrams and screen layouts.

3. **Design Sequence Diagrams**
    - Model detailed interactions for complex use cases using sequence diagrams.

4. **Design Class Diagrams**
    - Provide detailed documentation of domain and controller classes, their attributes, and methods.

5. **Database Design**
    - Derive the Entity Relationship Diagram from entity classes, normalize to 3rd normal form, and provide a data dictionary.

6. **Report Design**
    - Describe the reports that the system will generate, including requirements definitions for each report.

7. **Outputs and Controls**
    - Describe all system outputs and controls, including validation checks and business rules.

8. **Implementation Plan**
    - Detail the tasks required to move from the design stage to the final delivery of the system.

9. **Test Plan**
    - Include a plan for testing the system and a detailed set of test cases.

## Working C#.Net System Requirements

- Demonstrate user requirements as specified.
- Developed as a single-user system.
- Supported by an underlying relational database.
- Include all controls to ensure integrity and security of the system.
